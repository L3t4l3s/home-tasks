[![Validate](https://github.com/L3t4l3s/home-tasks/actions/workflows/validate.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/L3t4l3s/home-tasks/actions/workflows/validate.yaml)

A feature-rich, highly customizable task management solution for Home Assistant — combining a native **integration** (sensors, calendar, events, services) with a versatile Lovelace **dashboard card**. Supports linking **external todo lists** from CalDAV, Google Tasks, Todoist, Bring, Local Todo, and other providers.

## Features

### Per-Task Fields

Every task can carry up to 20 individual attributes:

- **Title** — inline rename with double-click
- **Notes** — free-text field per task
- **Due date** with overdue highlighting
- **Due time**
- **Priority** — Low / Medium / High with colored badges
- **Assigned person** — any HA person entity
- **Tags** — multiple tags for categorization
- **Sub-tasks** — nested checklist with progress bar
- **Reminders** — up to 5 per task, fire as HA events at a configurable offset before due time
- **Recurring** — fixed intervals: every N hours, days, weeks, months, years
- **Recurring (weekly)** — every N weeks on selected weekdays (Mon – Sun, any combination)
- **Recurring (monthly)** — every N months on a specific day (1–31 or "last") **or** an Nth weekday (1st – 4th + last × Mon – Sun) — e.g. "every 24th", "every last day", "every 2nd Saturday", "every last Wednesday every 2 months"
- **Recurring (yearly)** — every N years on a specific TT.MM anniversary (e.g. "every 24.12.")
- **Recurrence start date** ("Beginn")
- **Recurrence end date**
- **Maximum repetitions**
- **Completion state** with timestamp
- **Task history / audit log** — every field change recorded with actor and timestamp

### External Todo Lists

Display tasks from **any HA todo integration** alongside native Home Tasks lists — on the same card, in the same UI.

- Link external todo entities via **Settings > Integrations > Home Tasks > Link external todo list**
- Provider type is **auto-detected** (Todoist, CalDAV, Google Tasks, etc.) — no extra configuration needed
- For **generic providers** (CalDAV, Google Tasks, Shopping List, etc.): each field is bidirectionally synced only if the provider's todo entity advertises the matching capability (SET_DUE_DATE, SET_DESCRIPTION, …). Everything else — priority, tags, sub-tasks, reminders, recurrence, and base fields the provider can't hold — lives in a local overlay so every Home Tasks feature keeps working.
- For **Todoist**: full bidirectional sync via direct API access — see [Todoist Deep Integration](#todoist-deep-integration) below
- The card editor **auto-configures visibility** based on the provider's capabilities when you select an external list
- You can manually enable overlay fields for external lists if you want them locally

#### Verified Providers

| Provider | HA Integration | Title & Status | Due Date | Due Time | Description | Reorder | Priority | Labels | Sub-tasks | Assignee | Recurrence | Reminders | Notes |
|----------|---------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|-------|
| **CalDAV** (Nextcloud, etc.) | [CalDAV](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/caldav/) (Core) | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | |
| **Google Tasks** | [Google Tasks](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_tasks/) (Core) | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | no | no | no | no | no | no | Google's REST API does not expose due times or recurrence ([open issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36759725)). The Google Tasks web UI shows recurrence dropdowns, but those are written client-side only and never appear in the API — Home Assistant therefore can't read or write them. Use Home Tasks' local recurrence (executed by the integration, not the provider). |
| **Todoist** | [Todoist](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/todoist/) (Core) | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | Full bidirectional sync via direct Todoist API |
| **Local Todo** | [Local Todo](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/local_todo/) (Core) | yes | yes | no | yes | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | Simple file-based lists built into HA |
| **Bring** | [Bring](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bring/) (Core) | yes | no | no | yes | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | Shopping list — all extra fields available locally via overlay |
| **Shopping List** | [Shopping List](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/shopping_list/) (Core) | yes | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | no | Minimal core shopping list — title+status only; all extra fields via overlay |

**yes** = bidirectionally synced with the provider. **no** = not synced, but still available locally in Home Tasks via overlay.

Any other integration that creates `todo.*` entities following HA's standard `TodoListEntity` should also work.

Tasks can be **moved between native and external lists** via drag & drop on multi-column cards. Fields that the target provider cannot sync are preserved in the local overlay.

#### Todoist Deep Integration

When you link a Todoist list, Home Tasks automatically detects the Todoist provider and uses the **Todoist REST API directly** (via the existing Todoist integration's API token — no extra configuration required). This enables full bidirectional sync for nearly all fields including title, status, description, due date/time, priority, labels/tags, sort order, sub-tasks, assigned person, recurrence, and reminders.

Home Tasks uses its **own lightweight REST API client** (no dependency on `todoist-api-python`) to communicate directly with the Todoist API. The only requirement is the existing HA Todoist integration being configured — the API token is read from its config entry automatically.

**Unsupported Todoist features** (not synchronized):

- **Comments** — Todoist has a threaded comment system with timestamps and multiple authors; Home Tasks uses a single notes/description field
- **Attachments** — file attachments on tasks or comments
- **Sections** — task grouping within Todoist projects
- **Task duration** — how long a task takes (e.g. 30 minutes)
- **Label colors** — Todoist labels have their own colors and ordering
- **Deadline vs. due date** — Todoist separates planned work date (due) from deadline
- **Favorites** — marking tasks or projects as favorites
- **Saved filters** — Todoist's own filter query language

### Sections

Group tasks within a list under named, optionally icon-bearing **sections** that render as headers between rows. Auto-sort runs *within* each section so manual order is preserved across groups; completed tasks pool in a single "Done" header at the bottom and return to their original section on reopen. Sections live with the list (server-side), so every card and every dashboard sees the same sections — and tasks created from voice, automations, or HA's todo entity can be assigned to a section just like via the card.

Manage sections from the **card editor → Sections**: add, rename, change icon, reorder, delete (tasks fall back to "no section" — never lost). On the card itself, sections can be **collapsed / expanded** with a tap on the header (state persists per browser); during drag & drop, hovering a collapsed section header for ~600 ms automatically opens it ("spring-loaded folder") so you can drop into it. The "Done" header is the only header that's not a drop target — completion is changed via the checkbox.

Typical use: a shopping list whose sections are store aisles ("Produce", "Frozen", "Bakery"), a project list grouped by status, or a chore list grouped by room. v1 supports manual assignment; auto-assignment by tag, title keyword, or learned history is on the roadmap.

### Dashboard Card

- **Multi-column layout** — display multiple lists side-by-side on a single card
- **Per-column configuration** — title, icon, default filter, default sort, show/hide every field individually
- **Sections** — group tasks under named headers with optional icons (see above)
- **Drag & drop** reordering on desktop and mobile, including across sections
- **Cross-list drag & drop** — move tasks between columns (multi-column cards only)
- **Click anywhere** to expand / collapse task details
- **Double-click title** to rename inline
- **Filter** per column — All / Open / Done, plus optional **Due Soon** filter (shows tasks due within a configurable number of days)
- **Sort** per column — manual, due date, priority, title, assigned person
- **Tag & person filter chips** in the column header
- **Compact mode** for denser task rows
- **Auto-delete** completed tasks (optional, per column)
- **Smooth animations** — FLIP transitions for sort, filter, create, delete, complete, and reopen
- **Visual card editor** — fully configurable without writing YAML

### Home Assistant Integration

- **7 automation events**: created, completed, reopened, due, overdue, assigned, reminder
- **Services**: add, complete, reopen, and assign tasks from automations
- **Sensors**: open task count + overdue binary sensor per list
- **Calendar**: each native list gets a `calendar.*` entity — tasks with due dates appear as all-day or timed events, usable in any HA calendar card or automation
- **Todo entity**: each native list is exposed as a standard `todo.*` entity with full HA todo platform support (Companion App, Apple Watch, etc.)
- **Multiple lists** via separate integration config entries

### Languages

Available in 15 languages — follows your HA language setting automatically:

English · German · French · Spanish · Portuguese · Italian · Dutch · Polish · Swedish · Danish · Norwegian · Finnish · Czech · Russian · Hungarian

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

Home Tasks is available in the HACS default repository.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the Home Tasks repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=L3t4l3s&repository=home-tasks&category=integration)

1. Click the button above — or open HACS and search for **Home Tasks**
2. Click **Download**
3. Restart Home Assistant

> **Install as an integration, not a frontend/plugin.** Home Tasks bundles its
> dashboard card and registers it for you — there is **no** Lovelace resource to
> add manually. If you add the repository as a *Plugin* in HACS, it lands under
> `config/www/community/…` and the card will not be served by the integration.

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/home_tasks` folder into your `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Setup

### Native Lists

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for **Home Tasks**
3. Click **Add Service**
4. Choose **Create a new task list**
5. Enter a name for your list
6. Repeat for additional lists

### External Lists

1. Set up the external provider's HA integration first (e.g. CalDAV, Google Tasks, Todoist)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
3. Search for **Home Tasks**
4. Click **Add Service**
5. Choose **Link an external todo list**
6. Select the todo entity from the dropdown
7. The external list is now available in the card editor

The Lovelace card is automatically registered — just add it to your dashboard.

### Entities

For each native list, the integration creates:

- **Todo** (`todo.{list_name}`): Standard HA todo entity — works with the Companion App, Apple Watch, Google Home, and any HA automation that targets `todo.*` entities.
- **Calendar** (`calendar.{list_name}_calendar`): Tasks with a due date appear as calendar events. Tasks with only a due date show as all-day events; tasks with both due date and due time show as 1-hour timed events with a rich description (notes, priority, assignee, tags, sub-task progress, reminders).
- **Sensor** (`sensor.{list_name}_open_tasks`): Number of open tasks. Attributes: `open_task_titles`, `overdue_count`.
- **Binary Sensor** (`binary_sensor.{list_name}_overdue`): `on` if any task is past its due date.

### Example Automations

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Home Tasks: Reminder notification"
