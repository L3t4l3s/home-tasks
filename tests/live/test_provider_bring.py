"""Live tests for the Bring (shopping list) provider via the GenericAdapter.

Bring is a shopping-list app with a much smaller field surface than other
providers — basically just title (item name).  Everything else goes through
our overlay, and those overlay fields must NEVER leak into Bring's state
(e.g. someone shoving "priority=3" into the item description would corrupt
the user's shopping list in the Bring app).

Setup:  HT_BRING_TEST_ENTITY=todo.<your_test_list>
