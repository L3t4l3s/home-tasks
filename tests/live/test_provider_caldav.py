"""Live tests for the CalDAV/Nextcloud provider via the GenericAdapter.

CalDAV uses the GenericAdapter (HA's standard todo entity interface) to
talk to Nextcloud.  We verify every CRUD path both through our merged
home_tasks view and through ``todo.get_items`` directly against the
CalDAV entity — if Nextcloud never received the change, the second view
catches it.

For overlay-only fields (priority, tags) we also assert that the CalDAV
item's summary and description stay clean; an accidental "smuggle tags
into the description" would show up as actual garbage in the user's
Nextcloud tasks.

Timing note: the test server runs Nextcloud on SQLite, which is slow
and occasionally needs multiple seconds for a round-trip to settle.
All waits are deliberately generous, and reads retry briefly before
failing.

Setup:  HT_CALDAV_TEST_ENTITY=todo.<your_test_collection>
